# Next.js Starter

This Next.js app demonstrates how various Next.js features work on Netlify. It generates dummy pages by pulling data from publically accessible APIs so it can be deployed without any config.

You can customise the number of static pages it builds by modifying the following environmental variable

```
NUMBER_OF_STATIC_PAGES=100
```
